<p>I learned how to use a website called scratch. In this website, you can basically design your own game.
</br>The first thing that I learned was about how to use is conditions.
</br> I was afraid of using certain conditions.
</br>  I used many conditions, and it was fun looking at my options.
</br> There are so many things that you can do on scratch, and everything it right in front of you. </br> All you have to do it drag it out, and connect it to get a character to do what you what it to do. </br> I enjoyed this the most because you can actually see what is going on. </br> The character can have a talk bubble, and a thought bubble where I can make them talk or think whatever I want to show them thinking. </br> I had an assignment to make a dance competition, and the partner work that I really enjoyed.</p>
My favorite scratch game that I created was with numbers. I made up an entire unique looking game in my eyes. That is all that matters.
