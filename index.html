<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
I learned a lot in this GIRLS WHO CODE Program. This was a big opportunity for me to get a job doing something that will benefit me in the future. It was challenging enough for me to learn, and get through the lessons. I was introduced to so many helpful websites that will help me get the result that I want in coding, that will change something in a particular way that is very unique. I am excited to see what I do with this information that I learned. I will go to my senior year of school meanwhile, I will look into learning more in Girls Who Code club, and participate in extracuricular activities that I really enjoy.
</p>

<p>
  I want to thank my teacher, Tisha, Danyaile, and Abigail for all that for what they have taught me. I want to thank my mom for being open minded for this idea of learning. I have no choice to thank my Mom and Dad for coming with me to and from work for my own saftety.
</p>

<p>
  One of the things that I found was challenging in the GirlsWhoCode program is that I did not have the info or someone to give me the right to tell myself that my projects were going to be perfect. </br> I am a perfectionist, so I have that way of thinking that anything that I get my hands on has to be perfect. Normally, I would use that to make myself become a sponge. </br> I am adapted to learning like a teacher releasing brain knowledge, and I would have to organize it in my own way.  </br>I was taught step by step which was good for a content that I have no experience in. This program was benefitial to me. I just do not know exactly where and how I will use this information yet. </br>There are so many ways of using this information, and I am nervous to see what I will do with it. I have learned so many things here.</br> There is a lot here that would supprise a teenager when it comes to learning. I recommend that teenage girls try this program because it is an experience that prepares you for the times in the real world when something happens that you may not have prepared for. It was challenging to deal with this type of teaching: the way that they teach. Here you can adapt to something that will change the way you think of the world. </br> You will find a way to bring the skills to your benefit in some way whether it's making a website for someone, get paid to teach coding, or getting into a job in the technology world. You will find something to do.

<h2>SCRATCH!!!!!</h2>

<p>I learned how to use a website called scratch. In this website, you can basically design your own game.  </br>The first thing that I learned was about how to use is conditions. </br> I was afraid of using certain conditions. </br>  I used many conditions, and it was fun looking at my options. </br> There are so many things that you can do on scratch, and everything it right in front of you. </br> All you have to do it drag it out, and connect it to get a character to do what you what it to do. </br> I enjoyed this the most because you can actually see what is going on. </br> The character can have a talk bubble, and a thought bubble where I can make them talk or think whatever I want to show them thinking. </br> I had an assignment to make a dance competition, and the partner work that I really enjoyed.</p>
My favorite scratch game that I created was with numbers. I made up an entire unique looking game in my eyes. That is all that matters.

<p>
  Python is something that many people do not know because it is new. Lucky me, I got to learn a little about how to work Python. It was more challenging

<div id="Robotics">
<h2>Robotics</h2>

<p>
  I learned that robotics is a really complex subject. It is a combination of coding, and programing. In this subject, it is essential for people to be patient, open mined, and thorough about their work. You will work in a group because there is a lot of work that needs to be done for one robot to do what you want it to do.
</br>I did not do much in the subject of rebotics, but I got the chance to see a documentary at Liberty Science Center. I learned that it is important that you learn how to work with others because there is constant communication. Everyone is working on one idea of the big project. If there is a problem, everyone is checking for the problem. The video showed me what being on a robotics team is about. I may not have the smartest mind, but that documentary taught me that I have a purpose. My purpose in life is important to me. I don't know my purpose. But I know that when I find my purpose, I will not let the opportunity past me by. Your purpose is your purpose. My purpose is waiting for me.
